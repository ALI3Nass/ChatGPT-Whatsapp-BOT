# ChatGPT-Whatsapp-BOT
A chatbot for whatsapp that uses chatgpt to answer your quries


# A python Script that:
  Launches a Firefox browser using the Playwright library and opens the OpenAI chat website. It then defines several functions to interact with the chat interface, such as finding the input box, sending messages, and retrieving the latest message.

A flask app that:
  Listens for GET requests with a "q" parameter (which is the message to send to the chat), sends the message using the send_message() function, and returns the response using the get_last_message() function.

# A GO Script that:
  Uses the WhatsMeow library to create a WhatsApp chatbot. The program connects to a WhatsApp account and listens for incoming messages. When a message is received, it sends the message to a chatbot server running on localhost:5001, and sends the response back to the sender of the original message. The program also generates a QR code that can be scanned with a mobile phone to log in to the WhatsApp account.
